<!-- ABOUT -->
## About The Project
A business card with embedded IPS display, SMD pushbuttons, and a XIAO nRF5240 Sense designed to run off a slim LiPo Battery.
The goal of this PCB is to create an artistic business card for conventions, maker spaces, and other social events that stands out either assembled or unassembled for portability.

This PCB is used to interface a XIAO nRF5240 Sense with the following components:
- SMD Pushbuttons
- IPS Display
- Power Source (Lipo Battery)

I did some research on artistic designs and found people using soldermask as a visual aesthetic. When the board is finished with ENIG, it produces a protected and nice gold finish.
For the board thickness I went with 0.8mm. (Typical board is 1.6mm). For future revisions, I may make the board even thinner.
The end goal is not use a breakout board and to simply have the nRF5240 or another board like the ESP32-S3 bare chip used along with battery charging and microphone circuits to reduce the physical space taken up. 

<!-- Software -->
### Software Design
With 4x buttons available along with a microphone input, a variety of things can be displayed on the screen.
I wanted to incorporate a menu system so I can toggle between different modes such as a battery readout display, static image display such as for a QR code, a looping GIF display, a sound reactive display mode, and a control mode to set ambient audio input levels. The limitation of all of this is the amount of flash memory on the XIAO nRF5240. For future revisions, I can incorporate a microSD card.
